# Jade Hack
This repo has some notebooks for getting started with the Jade hack. You can explore Jupyter Notebook and start playing with some big data processing.

## Getting started
1. Sign in with your github account at [http://devel.jupyter.informaticslab.co.uk](http://devel.jupyter.informaticslab.co.uk). (If you can't get access, let Niall know and he can white-list you).
1. Click on "New" and choose "Terminal" to start a new terminal. You may want to type "bash" *enter* at the terminal to get a more useful console
1. Execute `git clone https://github.com/niallrobinson/jade-hack.git` to copy this repo to your workspace. (If you want to be fancy, you can fork it first and clone that - don't worry if you don't know what that means.)
1. From your home Jade screen, open the `jade-hack` directory. You can click on any of the notebooks to run them.
1. Go to the [issues page](https://github.com/niallrobinson/jade-hack/issues) for this repo where you can find things to try.

## What's a 'Jade'?
Jade is the Met Office Informatics Lab's prototype data analysis platform. If you want to find out more about Jade, you can find some blog posts on the informatics lab website:
